PokemonSorting

This code is used to implement a program that sorts nine different datasets with data on Pokemon and their total stats

The purposes of each of the following files are stated below:


pokemonSort.py - to output nine different datasets with the total stats for Pokemon, where each of these datasets are 
                 sorted using the Insertion Sort, Quicksort, and Merge Sort algorithms; also outputs the number of 
                 comparisons made for each resulting sort as an estimation of runtime

data - a folder containing the nine datasets to be sorted, each of which has a column identifying the Pokemon and a column 
       with the Total Stats:
  - pokemonRandomLarge.csv
  - pokemonRandomLarge.csv
  - pokemonRandomSmall.csv
  - pokemonReverseSortedLarge.csv
  - pokemonReverseSortedMedium.csv
  - pokemonReverseSortedSmall.csv
  - pokemonSortedLarge.csv
  - pokemonSortedMedium.csv
  - pokemonSortedSmall.csv


Compile the source code by typing the following at the prompt $:
